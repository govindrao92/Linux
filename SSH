SSH or Secure Shell is a network communication protocol that enables two computers/devices to communicate and share data.

There are two ways to access the remote server 
using password
without a password (bypassing the SSH key )

Why does SSH need it? 
if you frequently access the server it's a good idea to configure your ssh keys so that you can log in without a password.

steps 
1. Generate a New SSH key pair on the Local Machine. (#ssh-keygen)
2. copy the Public key to the Remote Machine. (# ssh-copy-id )
3. Login to a remote server without a password.

Step1: Generate an SSH key using ssh-keygen 
ssh-keygen

you can check the generated keys using 
ls -l .ssh
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

step2: Copy your public SSH key Geerateto remote server, (on the remote server it is copied under ~/.ssh/authorized keys file)

ssh-copy-id root@192.168....
